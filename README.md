What is Shell-scripting and its uses?

Shell scripting is a powerful tool commonly used across industries to automate tasks, test solutions, and increase efficiency. 

Shell scripting is a text file with a list of commands that instruct an operating system to perform certain tasks.

Shell scripting is primarily used to automate repetitive system tasks, such as backing up files, monitoring system resources, and managing user accounts. 

By turning a series of commands into a script, system administrators can save time, increase accuracy, and simplify complex tasks.
